## Summary

Compliance, whether for security, regulatory, or internal policies, is a fundamental requirement of all applications and environments. Cloud scale and speed can make compliance very complex and labor-intensive without the right tools and practices. In this episode you will learn how AWS enables compliance automation and reporting.

In episode two, you will enable the service [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) which enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. Additionally, you will enable the service [AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) which enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account.
