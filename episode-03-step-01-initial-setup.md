## Summary

In this section of the workshop you create an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Windows instance with a PowerShell script that will stress test the CPU and consume CPU credits, if any are available. In the next section, you will create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that monitors CPU usage. You can (1) manually launch an EC2 instance and configure AWS Systems Manager or (2) you create these resources using [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

To create the test resources manually, skip to the section [Manual Instructions](#manual-instructions).

To create the resources using CloudFormation, skip to the section [CloudFormation instructions](#cloudformation-instructions).

    #
    #Download the script and save to the C: drive
    #
    Invoke-WebRequest `
        https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cloud-and-hybrid-operations-workshop/blob/main/misc/loop-and-stress.ps1 `
        -OutFile c:\loop-and-stress.ps1

    #
    #Create Registry Entry needed by the stress script
    #
    New-Item -Path HKLM:\SOFTWARE -Name "benfelip"
    Set-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SOFTWARE\benfelip -Type DWORD -Name CrazyLogs -Value 1

    #Setup the trigger to run everytime it boots
    $trigger = New-JobTrigger -AtStartup -RandomDelay 00:00:30
    Register-ScheduledJob -Trigger $trigger -FilePath c:\loop-and-stress.ps1 -Name StressCPU

    </powershell>
    ```

1. Choose **Launch**.
1. For **Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair**, choose **Proceed without a key pair** from the drop-down list, choose the check-box for **I acknowledge that I will not be able to connect to this instance unless I already know the password built into this AMI** and choose **Launch Instances**.
    - **Note**: In the next section you will use Session Manager to remotely connect to the EC2 instance which does not require a key pair.

### Enable Quick Setup to create and attach the IAM role

Use AWS Systems Manager Quick Setup to quickly configure frequently used AWS services and features with recommended best practices. You can use Quick Setup in an individual account or across multiple accounts and AWS Regions by integrating with AWS Organizations. Quick Setup simplifies setting up services, including AWS Systems Manager, by automating common or recommended tasks. These tasks include, for example, creating required AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instance profile roles and setting up operational best practices, such as periodic patch scans and inventory collection.

**To setup Quick Setup Host Management**

1. Open the **AWS Systems Manager** console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.
1. In the navigation pane, choose [**Quick Setup**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/quick-setup).
1. Choose **Get started**.
1. Choose **Create**.
1. Choose **Host Management** and choose **Next**.

    - **Note**: If your AWS account is part of an AWS Organization and you are logged in to the root organization account, you also have an option to configure the Change Manager capability of Systems Manager.
    
1. On the **Customize Host Management configuration options**, ensure the defaults for **Systems Manager** are enabled:

    - Update Systems Manager (SSM) Agent every two weeks.
    - Collect inventory from your instances every 30 minutes.
    - Scan instances for missing patches daily.

1. In the **Targets** section, choose **Current Region** and choose **All instances**.
1. Choose **Create**.

    ![](/media/quick-setup-create.png)
    
    - Systems Manager Quick Setup will begin deploying a CloudFormation stack which creates the corresponding resources to enable Systems Manager best practices. After a few moments, the **Host Management** page should refresh and you can see the **Configuration deployment status**, **Configuration association status**, and **Configuration details** for the **Quick Setup** deployment.

    ![](/media/quick-setup-host-mgmt.png)

1. Choose the radio button for the current account and Region and choose **View details**.    
1. On the **Association drilldown** page, you can review the **Association status**, **Instances per status**, **Schedule rate**, and **Last updated** timestamp for each association created by **Quick Setup**.

###Â Create the KMS key

In order to fully manage the instance with Fleet Manager, you need to configure a KMS Key and I assume you are following this in order.

1. Open the **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms/home.
1. In the navigation pane, choose **Customer managed keys**.
1. Choose **Create key**.
1. On the **Configure key** page, leave the default value of **Symmetric** for the **Key type** and choose **Next**.
1. On the **Add labels** page, for **Alias** enter ```fleet-manager```, and choose **Next**.
1. On the **Define key administrative permissions** page, select your IAM user or role you are currently logged in with, and choose **Next**.
1. On the **Define key usage permissions** page, select the EC2 IAM instance profile role **AmazonSSMRoleForInstancesQuickSetup**, and choose **Next**.
1. On the **Review** page, choose **Finish**.
1. Once the KMS key is created, note the **Amazon Resource Name (ARN)** of the KMS key and copy the value.

### Add KMS permissions to the IAM role

1. Open the **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home.
1. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**.
1. Select the **AmazonSSMRoleForInstancesQuickSetup** role from the list to bring up the **Summary** page.
1. On the **Summary** page, choose **Add inline** policy.
1. On the **Create policy** page, choose the **JSON tab**.
1. Replace the default content with the following. 
    - **Important:** Replace **key-arn** with the ARN of the custom KMS key you created previously.

    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "kms:Decrypt"
                ],
                "Resource": "key-arn"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    
    ![](media/episode-03-kms-policy.png)

1. Choose **Review policy**.
1. For **Name**, enter ```KMS_Permissions``` and choose **Create policy**.
    
### Add KMS encryption to Session Manager preferences
