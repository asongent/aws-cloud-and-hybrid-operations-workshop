## Summary

AWS Systems Manager **Incident Manager** enables faster resolution of critical application availability and performance issues. It helps you prepare for incidents with automated response plans that bring the right people and information together. With Incident Manager, you can automatically take action when a critical issue is detected by an Amazon CloudWatch alarm or Amazon Eventbridge event. Incident Manager immediately executes pre-configured response plans to engage responders via SMS and phone calls, links designated chat channels using AWS Chatbot, and executes AWS Systems Manager Automation runbooks. Incident Manager helps you improve service reliability by suggesting post-incident action items, such as automating a runbook step or adding a new alarm, based on Amazonâ€™s post-incident analysis template.

### Create prerequisite resources using CloudFormation

The [CloudFormation template](cfntemplates/ssm-workshop-resources-episode-05.yml) creates a test Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance, IAM instance profile role for System Manager, an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for the instance to monitor CPU performance, an IAM role for Amazon EventBridge, and an EventBridge rule.

### Create test resources using CloudFormation

**To save the CloudFormation template locally**
    
1. Open the CloudFormation template [ssm-workshop-resources-episode-05.yml](cfntemplates/ssm-workshop-resources-episode-05.yml).
1. Choose **Raw**.

    ![](/media/github-raw.png)

1. Open Notepad and copy the entire text.
1. Save the file to your local machine as ```ssm-workshop-resources-episode-05.yml```.

The CloudFormation template will create the resources depicted in the diagram below.

### Create an escalation plan

Escalation plans use **stages** where each stage lasts a defined number of minutes. Each stage has the following information:

- **Duration** - The amount of time the plan waits until beginning the next stage. As soon as the engagement starts the first stage begins.
- **Contacts** - The escalation plan engages each contact using its defined engagement plan. You can set up each contact to stop the progression of the escalation plan before it goes to the next stage. Each stage can have multiple contacts.

**To create an escalation plan**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.
1. In the navigation pane, choose [**Incident Manager**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/incidents).
1. Choose **Prepare**.
1. On the **Get prepared** page, choose **Create escalation plan** in the **Escalation plans** section.
1. On the **Create escalation plan** page, perform the following steps:

    - For **Name**, enter ```workshop-escalation-plan```.
    - For **Alias**, enter ```workshop-escalation```.
    - Before making modifications to **Stage 1**, choose **Add stage**.
    - For **Stage 1**, perform the following steps:
        - For **Stage duration** enter ```15```.
        - For **Contact name**, select the first contact you created above (```yourname```) and disable **Acknowledgement stops plan progression**.
        - :information_source: By disabling this option, the engagement plan will escalate to **Stage 2** 15 minutes after the incident has been created.
    - For **Stage 2**, perform the following steps:
        - For **Contact name**, select the second contact you created above (```yourname-escalated```) and disable **Acknowledgement stops plan progression**.

1. Choose **Create escalation plan**.

### Create a response plan

Use response plans to plan for incidents and define how to respond to incidents. Response plans provide a template for when an incident occurs. This template includes information about who to engage, the expected severity of the event, automatic runbooks to initiate, and metrics to monitor. To create a response plan, use the following steps. 

**To create a response plan**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.
1. In the navigation pane, choose [**Incident Manager**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/incidents).
1. Choose **Prepare**.
1. On the **Get prepared** page, choose **Create response plan** in the **Response plan** section.
1. For **Response plan details**, enter the following:

    - For **Name** enter ```sampleapp-performance-issues-response-plan```.
        - :exclamation: **Important**: The name of the response plan is case-sensitive and must match exactly.
    - For **Display name**, enter ```SampleApp Performance Issues response plan```.
    
1. For **Incident creation details**, enter the following:

    - For **Title**, enter ```[SampleApp] Performance Issues Detected```.
    - For **Impact**, choose **High**.
    - Expand the **Additional options** section and enter the following:
