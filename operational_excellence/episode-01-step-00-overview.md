## Summary

AWS Systems Manager plays a key role in enabling operational excellence. AWS Systems Manager allows our customers to manage and enable the collection of operational telemetry from EC2 Instances, on-premise servers and virtual machines (VMs), and VMs in other cloud environments.

In this episode we will walk through setting up the Systems Manager (SSM) Agent on EC2, and using this to deploy and configure the CloudWatch Agent. Additionally, we will set up an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for performance metrics on the EC2 instance to create OpsItems in Systems Manager OpsCenter.
